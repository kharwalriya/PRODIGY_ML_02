Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering
Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project repository! This project focuses on clustering customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the K-means clustering algorithm.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project was to group customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behaviors. By identifying these clusters, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize product offerings.

Key Tasks and Achievements
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Obtained and cleaned customer purchase data to create a structured dataset suitable for clustering analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to gain insights into customer purchase patterns, identify trends, and determine relevant features for clustering.

Feature Engineering: Extracted meaningful features such as total purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and types of products purchased to capture customer behavior.

K-means Clustering Implementation: Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm using Python and the Scikit-Learn library to segment customers into clusters.

Cluster Analysis and Interpretation: Analyzed and interpreted the clusters to understand customer segments, their characteristics, and potential business implications.
